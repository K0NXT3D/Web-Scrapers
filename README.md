TerrorBot - Paparazzi - BashKat

These are all nice and simple, easy on the processor and server loads.
These worked great with proxychains, so if you're still using that..

The code for each is really the same.
General variations to the "bot" itself and how I use them on my end.
Using Chron is the best way if you're able to proxychains your IP address.
I only suggest that because these can get you blacklisted.
