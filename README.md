<h4>rrorBot - Paparazzi - BashKat</h4>

These are all nice and simple, easy on the processor and server loads.
These worked great with proxychains, so if you're still using that..

The code for each is really the same.
General variations to the "bot" itself and how I use them on my end.
Using Chron is the best way if you're able to proxychains your IP address.
I only suggest that because these can get you blacklisted.

Normally I don't even run the filenames and I have them in their own folders as "bot"
chmod +x and run ./bot.
I have the multi-bot launcher of course, I'm sure it's around here somewhere?

<p>Dir BashKat/</p>
     <p>./bot</p>
     
<em>Pretty Simple, Have fun making it your own.</em>
