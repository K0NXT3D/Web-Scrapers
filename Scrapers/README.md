<strong>These are "Cores"</strong>
<p>I write each one on an <em>"as needed"</em> basis, so each has a different purpose or use.<p>

<strong>BaskKat</strong> is a CLI Web Scraper with options between entering a single url or a file with multiple urls, one per line.<br>
<strong>TerrorBot</strong> is both CLI and PHP capable, designed to mirror or "Scrape" websites and is the "Grandfather" file.<br>
<strong>Paparazzi</strong> is a CLI ScreenShot Bot that can grab a screenshot by single url or list of multiple at one per line.<br>
<strong>H0zTyL</strong> is also both CLI or PHP and I've added a "spoofing" feature in order to eliminate having speed limits.<br>
<h2>BotKannon 1.0.1</h2>
<p>BotKannon is a "MultiThread Launcher" that can launch a bot file ~n times.<br>
Designed for use with H0zTyL, but can be used with TerrorBot using urls.txt</p>
